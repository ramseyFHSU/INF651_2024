 In this challenge, you will build an interactive form that responds to click events, mouse events, and keyboard events. 
 Your task is to create a form that accepts a user’s name, tracks mouse movements inside a designated area, 
 and handles form submissions via both mouse click and the "Enter" key.

 Implement the following functionality using JavaScript:

Click Event: 

When the "Submit" button is clicked, display a welcome message inside outputDiv that says "Welcome, [name]!" (where [name] is the user’s input). 
Change the background color of outputDiv to green when the button is clicked. 
If no name is entered, show an error message in red saying "Error: Please enter a name."

Mouse Event: 

Track the mouse movements inside the mouseTracker area. 
Display the mouse’s X and Y coordinates in real-time inside the coordinates div.

Keyboard Event: 

When the user types into the input field and presses the "Enter" key, trigger the submit button automatically without needing to click it. 
Prevent submission if the input field is empty.

Expected Outcome:

After clicking the "Submit" button (or pressing "Enter"), a welcome message is displayed if the user entered a name, and the background color changes to green. 
If the input field is empty, an error message in red should appear.

The X and Y coordinates of the mouse should be updated and displayed as the user moves their mouse inside the mouseTracker area.
The form should b
